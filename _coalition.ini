### LDAP configuration ###
# LDAP server to use for authentication
# If not empty, coalition will require a login and a password at every requests
; ldaphost=ldap://localhost

# Set to True to prevent password validation for API requests.
# Useful for scripts using API as it prevents hard-writing passwords.
# Authentification is still required while serving index.html to force web frontend users login.
; ldapunsafeapi=True

# LDAP base (used for searches)
; ldapbase=dc=ldap,dc=localhost,dc=lan

# LDAP template used to validate the user, eg.
# uid=cn=__login__,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
# where __login__ will be replaced by the user login
; ldaptemplatelogin = cn=__login__,dc=ldap,dc=localhost,dc=lan

### Group permissions ###
# Permissions are defined following the generic CRUD actions.
# Two major modes are predefined: per user or global.
# Per user mode offers CRUD actions only for jobs owned by the user.
# Global mode offers CRUD actions to the user for any job.
#
# Per user actions:
# createjob: User can create jobs owned by himself.
# viewjob: User can see his jobs.
# editjob: User can edit his jobs.
# deletejob: User can delete his jobs.
# 
# Global actions:
# createjobglobal: User can create a job owned by any other user.
# viewjobglobal: User can see any job.
# editjobglobal: User can edit any job.
# deletejobglobal: User can delete any job.
#
# LDAP template are used to validate that the user belongs to a specific group
#
# For instance, 3 permission groups can be defined in LDAP this way:
# 1. administrators: Can create, view, edit and delete any job.
# 2. wranglers: Can create, view and edit any job (but not delete).
# 3. artists: Can create, view, edit and delete only his own jobs.
#
# __login__ is replaced by the username.

[worker]
# Worker configuration

# Server URL, like http://serverhost:19211, let it blank to use autodetection by broadcasting.

# Worker name (default is host name)

# Sleep time between two heartbeats in seconds (default is 2)
#sleep=2

# Maximum number of cpus per worker, will override the number of workers when defined (Windows only)
#cpus=None

# Command to execute at worker startup
#startup=

# Display verbose logs
#verbose=0

# Customize the command used to run the job.
#
# The command set in runcommand is responsible for :
# * changing the user
# * changing the working directory
# * run the job command with the current environment
#
# The following pattern will be replaced:
# __user__ : the job user name
# __dir__ : the job directory
# __cmd__ : the job command
#
# If runcommand is blank, the worker set the working directory to the job directory
# and run the command using the worker permissions.

# Default run command
#runcommand=

# Run the jobs using sudo
#runcommand=sudo -u __user__ -E -- sh -c 'cd __dir__; __cmd__'

# Workers log file
#logfile=./worker.log
